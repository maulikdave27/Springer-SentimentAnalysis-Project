More Dallas ASE Information,"The start time for Tuesday morning has been changed from 9am to 8am.
Breakfast will be served at 7:30.  Therefore, shuttle pick up times at the
hotel for Tuesday morning have been changed to 7:10, 7:25, and 7:40 am.
Again, the last shuttle is not recommended if you intend to have breakfast at
the ASE.

Some of you had asked about a coordinated dinner for Sunday night.  Since
arrival times into Dallas vary greatly, we are leaving you to your own
devices for Sunday night.  We are however, planning a group dinner for Monday
night after we wrap up for the day.  We will arrange transportation from the
ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel.  Currently,
Monday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm.  Therefore, we are
planning to head to dinner directly from the ASE without a break or trip back
to the hotel.

RAC risk reporting,"Currently, members of Ted Murphy's group have been preparing certain
non-standard reports at the request of commercial.  These reports can be
categorized as:

""morning report"" - daily
Component V@R - daily
Adhoc V@R - as needed
Book reconciliation - as needed
Stress testing - as needed
Back testing - weekly
Correlation Matrix - bi-weekly


I have obtained a copy of all reports currently being prepared.  In the
upcoming weeks we need to transfer the preparation of these reports from RAC
to Risk Operations.  In order to do that, on a report by report basis, we
need to determine what group within Risk Operations should prepare these
reports (Risk Management and Controls or the individual commodity risk
management groups).

In the next couple days,  I will be sending you each a listing of reports
prepared, and then set up a time to meet with you so we can determine the

Internet E-mail,"
In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses.

Emily's First Pictures,"Just so you can see where my paycheck now goes.  What a great way to spend
money!

Here are some pictures from the first roll of film - Emily was about 5 or 6
days old.  She brings me joy I never thought possible.  And I'm sure some day
she'll bring me some pain, but I'm not thinking about that right now.  I
didn't know how easy it was to fall in love.  I am a different person
(better) because of her.
Yesterday, we made our first trip to the pediatrician and he said that she
was doing fine.  She gained  7 ounces!  She's quite a good little eater.  We
are settling into a routine and she sleeps about 4 hours at a time so it
gives me time to get a fair amount of rest.  We'll probably make a trip down
to the EB in a few weeks and I'll be sure to let you know exactly when.  I
hope you all are doing well -- stay in touch.  Here's the pictures.....(by

OU Salaries,"Sally,

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about,
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary
issue to your attention.

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for
consistency amongst the program participants.

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to ""soften the
blow"".

Prudency Release,"As you may well know we are being pushed by Arthur Andersen to bring our
prudency policy in line with that of North America.  In response to these
pressures, we have conducted a thorough review of our prudency policy and
have determined that all discretionary prudency and general reserves
(including VAR based prudency) should be eliminated. Deal specific prudency
will, however, remain. In order to avoid any arguments with AA near the
quarter end the release to the London summary DPR should happen today for the
August month end.

Apologies for the short notice but the final decision was only made very
recently. Please pass this message around to those people in your groups who
are not on the above mail list so that 'everyone' is aware of the change.

If there are any questions please let me know.

We Got the Money!!,"
As I alluded to in my note yesterday, Enron has received a commitment for $1 billion in additional credit from our agent banks. This is great news, more from a market perception standpoint than an actual cash need. You can be assured that senior management is totally focused on the need to shore up the balance sheet with additional equity, now that we have the debt in place, but the equity we be a longer process.

In the meantime, lets get back to work. I would encourage people to talk to their supervisors about this situation if you feel ""angst"".

*Updated* Nightly Duties and MDEA Load sheets folder,"Hello all,

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties.

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls.

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays,

Carrie

appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand,
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

So long,"Hey y'all,

as most of you would probably know by now, I have chosen to leave Enron to
pursue other opportunities.  It's been a good time (4+ years) with great
experiences both in North/South America and in Europe.

I'd like to use this e-mail to thank everybody for their good work and
friendship.  In particular (in order of appearance): Dung Tran, Jon Doyle,
Dave Ramm, Natalie Halich, Roberto Silveira and Rick Waddell have been great
sources of learning and leadership.

'Other opportunities' means exactly that - not quite sure what the next
adventure will be, but it won't be boring!  I encourage you to reply with
your personal e-mail etc., so that we can keep in touch.

All the best,
Christian

Re:,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a
round table discussion format.

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

(No Subject),"To whom it may concern:

In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's
employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag
football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with
regards to setting up the tournament?

Operational Risk Management was the topic of an information session held last
week for all managers, directors, senior directors and vice presidents in ENW
supporting trading operations for EA, EIM and EGM in Houston, Portland and
Calgary.  Operations professionals who manage risk book reporting and
anaylsis, confirmations, physical product scheduling and cash management
reaffirmed their roles in effectively accessing, managing and mitigating
operational risk.  This focus on operational risk management  will ensure the
quality of EWS' earnings and support a platform for continuing growth across

End of Season,"Eric,

Thanks for running the league.  It was fun.  And
thanks for selecting Boumann as your QB in the first
round of the playoffs.  And tell P-Love that I
appreciated him leaving Warner for me at the 7th pick
in the draft.

Anyway, since I no longer work in the Enron building,
it would probably be easiest to drop a check in the
mail:

Reagan Mathews
17210 Canyon Stream Ct.
Houston, TX  77095

By my calculation the amount should be:
$608.5

(1614-840) x 75% = 580.5 + $28 = $608.5.

$28 comes from...my total costs of -132, plus my paid
amount of 120, plus my winnings of 40.

The reason I bring this up is that it looks like the
""Finances"" page of the website is double counting the
$50 entry fee.  Anyway, let me know if you have a
different number for the distributions.

RAC risk reporting,"Currently, members of Ted Murphy's group have been preparing certain
non-standard reports at the request of commercial.  These reports can be

Stress testing - as needed
Back testing - weekly

I have obtained a copy of all reports currently being prepared.  In the
upcoming weeks we need to transfer the preparation of these reports from RAC
to Risk Operations.  In order to do that, on a report by report basis, we
need to determine what group within Risk Operations should prepare these
reports (Risk Management and Controls or the individual commodity risk
management groups).

In the next couple days,  I will be sending you each a listing of reports
prepared, and then set up a time to meet with you so we can determine the

Just wanted to get this out to you in the hope that you havent worked on January's and this month's schedule. I had already planned to be in Denver to ski (know any good resorts?) and then spend the new year with my family..earlier the plan was to do this from the26th onwards..as scheduled, but since we might not get our vacation from Enron at all.. I was wondering if everything being exegient, I could take off a little early and arrive into say the 4th or so of Jan?

This of course being that I dont upset too many other schedules and no news occurs upon us which would preclude this.

Also on an unrelated note..the people from Trader News called and wanted prices,...but I have not sent them anything not knowing our legal position on the same.

Data Integrity,"Andrea,

I am supposed to follow up and work on our action plan for data integrity.
However, I know that you are going to meet with David/Robert on the whole
concept and that you proposed a work around for the near term after our
sessions.  It appears as if our action plans will depend on the results of
that meeting.

I will be out of the office on Wed-Friday on business.  It looks like our
action plan revisions are due on Friday (but, if necessary, I'll ask for an
extension because of my travel).  In the meantime, you can meet with
David/Robert and begin to look at revamping our prior efforts.

Alternatively, you can reconvene the group and work on revising action plans
without me.  (I am not sure how helpful I am in any event).  What do you
think?

There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is

higher) and an extra day of flow (31 vs. 30).  Let me know if you have
further questions.

OU Salaries,"Sally,

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about,
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary
issue to your attention.

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for
consistency amongst the program participants.

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to ""soften the
blow"".

I look forward to your response.

Internet E-mail,"
In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.",4/12/2011,patti.thompson@enron.com,"effort protect enron 's e-mail system harmful virus , global messaging team implemented inbound outbound cluster mailsweeper server . mean , user ? inbound outbound internet mail passed set server scan message virus , malicious code , business related-content inappropriate content . inbound internet mail contains following attachment type quarantined ( held delivery ) : * .vbs , * .exe , * .com , * .bat , * .cmd . intended recipient one e-mail , receive automatic notification instruction get legitimate e-mail released quarantine . taken measure protect e-mail environment harmful e-mail virus . believe protection result less time e-mail , event enron get hit virus malicious code .",positive,1

(No Subject),"To whom it may concern:

In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's
employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag
football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with
regards to setting up the tournament?

Things are well.  Just looking forward to the weekend.  We are going to Happy
Hour tonight to celebrate Tim's engagement.  Shanna is going to visit Toni
tomorrow, apparently she has taken a turn for the worse.  Other than that,
just trying to get back into the work groove after all of that vacation.

Attached please find my resume for your review.  I liked to thank you for allowing me to sit with the shift guys for the past few nights.  The exposure has been invaluable.  I worked closely with Joe Errigo, who has been extremely helpful in showing me the routine of the job.  I received some hands on training with some of the work that is expected from the shift crew.  In particular, checkouts, price discovery, identifying constraint paths, input deals into the P&L  and Enpower.

The demanding and fast paced nature of this position is exactly what appeals to me.  My past experience with trading and scheduling should provide a good base.  I would like to sit down with you and discuss opportunities within your group.  Again, thank you for the opportunity, hope to hear from you soon.

ERMS Resources,"I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you
know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources
for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to ""catch up"", if
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going
basis.

I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS
as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production
support will be managed and how development work will be effectively
handled.

Enron Japan Trading,"Hi,  How is everyone doing?  Busy , Busy, Busy I know.

I am currently in the middle of selecting our Japan Banking Relationship and
several questions have come up.

It is important that I understand how your trading settlements will work.

I have spoken to Louise Kitchen about Enron Online and where it fits in with
our banking.  Enron Online does not interface with the banking.  It
interfaces with a trading system/accounting system?  What I need to know is
what system is planned for Enron Japan's accounting for the trading.  The
accounting system you use will interface with our Treasury system.

What it boils down to, is the payment format that we will use to make local
Japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the
Japanese  - English translation. The accounting system used will need to
interface with our Treasury software to process the settlements, we will need
to interface with the bank.

Please advise.

I know you guys are probably coming up on bidweek now and have very little time to interview.  I would really like a one on one with you to discuss opportunities as soon as you can  make some time available.

I hate to come out sounding like a pest, but, I am eager to start.   I want to work the night shift and get back into the fasted paced environment.  Thank you for your time, Don, hoping to hear from you soon.

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast (PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position caught my attention.

Disbanding of Joel Henenberg's Team,"I have a stretch goal for the operations budget under Enron Americas to
reduce costs by the end of the year.  To this end, I have recently studied
possible options for reaching the targeted savings.  To make the best
decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of
core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value
proposition.

As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team.
To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will
lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end
users.

Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week.
Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate
re-deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few
weeks.

Update to Bus Pass Information,"
Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee.

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00",8/30/2010,kayne.coulter@enron.com,"bus pass january available parking transportation office third floor enron building , ecn 306. pass offered monthly basis provided charge enron employee . however , bus pass fully subsidized must treated `` taxable '' income . excluding first $ 65 bus pas , remaining value subject taxation , collectively referred `` imputed tax '' . see example example : $ 100 pas chosen employee . subsidy bus pas $ 100.00 exclusion amount $ 65.00 taxable income amount $ 35.00",positive,1

Re: FW: LNG Weekly Update,"Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most
important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.
As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move
discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats
production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

They are gathering an extended set of information (including the items on the current matrix) on their top 25 exposures.  The top 25 exposures include the top exposures under Master agreements and in many cases include numerous contracts.  Chris said that the 26th exposure was about $10MM and one would need to get to about the 50th exposure to get below $1MM.  I asked him to forward down whatever they had completed to date so we could get educated and keep a central file.  He is also going to forward a call in number for a conference call tomorrow so we can begin to get educated on the current effort.

FINAL DECISION ON ACCRUAL VALUE,"Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value.
60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly
basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.

For example:

Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.

This means that:

Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000
Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000

Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000)
So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense
Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)

Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value
Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been
previously recognized.
Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.

MISO Approved for Start Up of Transmission Functions,"Yesterday, FERC gave approval for MISO to begin regional transmission operations on December 15, 2001.  This will include administration of their regional transmission tariff, security coordination, and ""other regional transmission organization functions.""  I expect they are going to function very similarly to the manner in which SPP and MAPP currently operate.  I verified this with Roger Harzy at the MISO, and he confirmed they plan to be operational on Dec. 15th.

I will be at MISO next week Tuesday and Wednesday, and will be working to make sure we are set up to take service under their tariff and fully understand their operations. If you have any specific questions, please send me mail, and I will work to address them while I am visiting.

*Updated* Nightly Duties and MDEA Load sheets folder,"Hello all,

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties.

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls.

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays,

2001 Plan vs 2000 Forecast Explanation,"Sarah,
Below is our high level explanation of the Energy Operations (including EOL)
increase in 2001 plan over 2000 forecast of $5.1 million.  If you have any
questions, please let me know.


Energy Operations has experienced a 140% increase in transaction growth as a
result of EOL activity, requiring additional resources to support this new
business.  However, resources have only increased at a rate of 11% due to the
efficient use of existing resources.  As a result the per unit cost of
supporting individual transactions has decreased significantly in the 100% to
400%+ range.

Order re. transfer of operational control to MISO,"On July 27, 2001, the Commission approved the application of Minnesota Power and Superior Water, Light and Power Company to transfer operational control of certain jurisdictional transmission facilities to the Midwest ISO when it becomes operational.  The approval was conditioned on Great River (MP's only network transmission customer) reaching agreement MP on how Great River's facilities will be operated by the ISO.

With regard to the Midwest RTO, the Commission stated its approval of the transfer of operational control does not constitute a finding regarding the scope of an RTO for the Midwest.

I'd like to use this e-mail to thank everybody for their good work and
friendship.  In particular (in order of appearance): Dung Tran, Jon Doyle,
Dave Ramm, Natalie Halich, Roberto Silveira and Rick Waddell have been great
sources of learning and leadership.

'Other opportunities' means exactly that - not quite sure what the next
adventure will be, but it won't be boring!  I encourage you to reply with
your personal e-mail etc., so that we can keep in touch.

All the best,

To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor,
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

A note on PMA's,"You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final
P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the
adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991
P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We
thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to
offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore,
the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.

I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of
November.

Happy New Year - No Y2K Fear!,"We are wrapping up several hours in the office and have tested all
commodities front to back.  We found a few minor issues, primarily reports
with report dates that were incorrect.  The content and underlying
calculations in the reports were correct.  These were really just query and
formatting issues.  All were quick fixes of five minutes or less.  So at this
point we feel confident about our system situation.  More will unfold with
counterparties next week, but hopefully all found this as uneventful as have
we.

Hope your new year's celebration was fun.  We saw pictures of the London

Doorstep RAC Direction,"Met today w/ Causey and Sally to discuss Doorstep going forward. Following is
my goal with this process.  Rick Carson will co-ordinate RAC's efforts in
this area pulling in other RAC people as required.


- RAC will participate in review to determine which offices will be inspected
and on what frequency
- RAC will help design and participate as required in inspections
- I will be able to see, through the RAC website, a list of all offices, a
list of all offices requiring inspection, when an office was inspected,
findings from that inspection and the follow-up from the findings.
- If follow up is not happening, a ""red flagged"" reminder notice should be
issued via email.

This has been a huge effort and we have to have this going forward. This is
one ball that can not be dropped.

Let me know your thoughts if any.

SEPA and schedules,"Hey guys,

I talked to Kayne on Monday about the various contracts we have with MDEA to ensure they continued for 2002.  KOCH, NRG, and SEPA all carry over. However, as Mike confirmed in checkouts, SEPA does NOT flow on weekends or holidays and SEPA puts out the tag without consulting us even though the schedule changes regularly.   Currently there is no SEPA schedule in OATI or the services contract book starting 01/07/2002.   Make sure when we do the next day schedules the SEPA contract matches OATI once SEPA puts out the new tags.

Last month we didn't have to place as close attention when scheduling because SEPA put out a tag for the entire month and Laura matched it in the services book for us.

And for your reference, the January Entergy OASIS #  for WR to MDEA (30MW all day) is: 1025604 (Daily NN-6).

Happy New Year!

Panama City Doorstep,"Dear Lynn,

As it turns out, there is no deal documentation for the Panama City deals in
Panama (everything is in Houston).  Therefore, the deal test will need to be
done from Houston and we won't need anyone from your group to attend the
upcoming doorstep.  Scott and Michelle Bruce will obtain the population when
then are in Panama and also write the report.

Best regards

Power Trader Position,"I saw a job posting for a Power Trader (24-Hr real time) in the Enron intranet and I was wandering if we could meet to discuss further.

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast (PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position caught my attention.

I hope you feel there may be a potential match here. If you think so, please let me know and I can forward you my resume.

Thank you

Ignacio

(No Subject),"Mac,

Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year

Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.

Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
(334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

Current price 37
Nat. Gas 34
Crude  10

Total  81


Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine,
Tosco, and SLB?

EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading

Re:,"Frank,

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

from last year unless anybody has an objection.  Still to be determined are

that can't make it, you can draft over the internet.  We will be using cbs
sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person.
